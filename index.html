                        Ensures the successful transition of new products (quartz analog and digital watches)
                        from development stage to a qualified mass-produced status.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensures product design manufacturability by: initiating the review of product and process 
                        design; lead the cross-functional team in the development and in the piloting activities 
                        (line set-up, tool debugging, and process qualification); generate/release/update product 
                        and process documentation of the new product.
                    </li>

                        Other responsibilities aside from the pilot project; I was also responsible for test and
                        measurement of watches that have Bluetooth and GPS functionality/capabilities.
                        Currently, I am tasked to develop a desktop GUI application using Python that
                        communicate to Bluetooth enabled devices to retrieve data to store in a database using
                        MySQL.
